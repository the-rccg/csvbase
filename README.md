# The CSV "(data)base"

Turn any directory with CSVs into a SQL query-able data-base-thingy.
All the benefits of human readable, portable, interoperable data.
None of the commitment of a database.

## Benefits

* Human readable data storage (duh it's CSVs)
* Trivial interoperability (it's CSVs)
* No technical knowledge required
* Allows querying with SQL!

## Drawbacks

* None of the performance gains of databases

## Mitigations

* Asynchronous parallel querying of CSVs?

# Usage

Run the `data_server.py` in the directory to be mapped. That's it. Enjoy.
